## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming was manually tested using user acceptance testing as detailed below:

---

### Restricted Pages and Admin Authentication

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix| Screenshot|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile | Logged-out users should be redirected to the sign-in page when accessing the profile URL. | Brute-forced the URL to the profile page. | Feature behaved as expected. | Test concluded and passed. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/ra-profile.gif) |
| Checkout Success | Logged-out users should not access other users' checkout-success pages. | Brute-forced the URL to a checkout-success page while logged out. | Feature failed to restrict access. Documented as an unfixed bug. | Unable to fix. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/ra-checkout-success.gif) |
| Add Product | Only admins should have access to this page. | Brute-forced the URL to the Add Product page.| Feature behaved as expected. | Test concluded and passed. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/ra-add-product.gif) |

| As a user, I want to see a friendly error message when I reach a 404 page so that I understand the page doesn't exist and can navigate back to the main site. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/error.png) |


## Automated Testing

This project did not include automated testing due to time constraints and the primary focus being on manual testing to ensure core functionality. All features were rigorously tested manually to verify their behavior against the defined user stories and acceptance criteria. While automated testing was not implemented, future development plans include integrating automated testing tools, such as Selenium or Pytest, to streamline the testing process and ensure consistent quality assurance for ongoing updates.


## Bugs

- **Logout Button Does Not Work**
    - When the logout button is clicked, the user is not logged out as expected.
    - ![screenshot](documentation/bug/logout/logout.png)
    - To resolve the issue, the following line was added to the `settings.py` file:
        ```python
        # Ensures logout is performed on a GET request
        ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_GET = True
    - ![screenshot](documentation/bug/logout/logout-fix.png)


## Unfixed Bugs

- **Known Bug: URL Brute-Forcing for Checkout Confirmation**
    - ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/ra-checkout-success.gif)
    - A vulnerability allows users to brute-force the URL of another user's checkout-success page if they know the URL. While this issue exists, fixing it would require preventing unsigned users from purchasing products, which is a limitation discussed in the Code Institute's Boutique Ado walkthrough. The risk is reduced because the URLs are unique, making it unlikely for users to guess them. Future updates may consider adding more security to address this.
